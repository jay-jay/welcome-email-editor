Tested up to: 3.1

A Plugin to provide an interface for the Wordpress Welcome Email. Allows adding of headers to prevent emails going into spam and changes to the text.

== Description ==

I thought that the Wordpress Welcome Email to both the Admin and the User were very un-user friendly so I wrote this plugin to allow admin members to change the content and headers.

It simply adds a new admin page that has a few options for the welcome email and gives you a list of hooks to use in the text to make the email a little more personal.

Added support whereby the admin notification can be turned off or a different admin (or admins, support for multiple recipients) can be notified. Plenty of hooks to make the emails as customisable as possible. 

Please email me or use the support forum if you have ideas for extending it or find any issues and I will be back to you as soon as possible.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the contents of the ZIP file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the admin page it creates at the bottom of the left menu
4. Edit the settings as desired and click save.

Once complete, all new user emails will be sent in the new format.
